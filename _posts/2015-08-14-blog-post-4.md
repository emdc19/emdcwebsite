‚ñ∂ Porous sedimentary rock, compaction bands form
perpendicular to ùúé1: grain crushing, cataclastis,
porosity/permeability reduction. Geological reservoirs, CO2
storage, and hazardous waste.
‚ñ∂ Elastoplastic damage + grain crushing + pore collapse
instability to model compaction bands in porous rocks.
‚ñ∂ Constitutive models often phenomenological. User-bias.
‚ñ∂ Shale sedimentary rock, clay mineral makeup give ductility and
self-healing. Low porosity/permeability ‚Üí seal or cap rock.
‚ñ∂ Shale is laminated and transversely isotropic. But hyperelastic
models used in shale computational modeling designed for
rubbers.
‚ñ∂ Constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs)
automatically discover hyperelastic model. CANNs (Linka and
Kuhl, 2023) ensure physically interpretable, thermodynamically
and mechanistically constrained neural networks.
‚ñ∂ Design CANN architecture to incorporate transverse isotropy.
Energy Geomechanics:
Using my coupled solid-fluid hydromechanical models and damage model
in SPH method to model fluid flow reduction across compaction bands.
Upscale to basin-scale modeling of fluid injection or recovery
