Using DEM method and experiments + PIV, failure and localization
precursors in granular media, granular force chains. Dynamic loading of
granular materials. Circumvent phenomenological constitutive models
Particulate nature of discrete element method (DEM) avoids constitutive models. Emergent
behavior. Focus on high-resolution models of accretionary wedges, and fault propagation direction.
Failure precursors and intermittent or â€œweak shear bands
