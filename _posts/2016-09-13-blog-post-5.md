Increasing climate volatility demands understanding **post-failure behavior** and designing **resilient, safe-to-fail** infrastructure. **Large deformations (SPH):** Coupled hydromechanical SPH for geomechanical problems such as fault rupture, retrogressive landslides and embankment failure, tailings dam stability/failure, dynamic & static liquefaction. **Wave/debris flowâ€“structure interaction:** Simulating waves impacting coastal/offshore structures (e.g., wind turbines). **Scalability:** Large-scale 3D simulations leveraging HPC. **Future:** Regional-scale simulation of dam and levee failure (e.g., overtopping, storm surge), and 2D/3D dam-break flood modeling to support emergency action planning.Figure showing development of a retrogressive flowslide type landslide: ![Retrogressive landslide (SPH)](/images/retro.jpg)
