Increasing climate volatility demands understanding **post-failure behavior** and designing **resilient, safe-to-fail** infrastructure.

**Large deformations (SPH):** Coupled hydromechanical SPH for geomechanical problems such as retrogressive landslides and embankment failure; building on dissertation work in SPH (tailings dam stability/failure, dynamic & static liquefaction).

**Wave/debris flow–structure interaction:** Simulating waves impacting coastal or offshore structures (e.g., wind turbines).

**Scalability:** Large-scale 3D simulations leveraging HPC.

**Future:** Regional-scale simulation of dam and levee failure (overtopping, storm surge) and 2D/3D dam-break flood modeling to support emergency action planning.
