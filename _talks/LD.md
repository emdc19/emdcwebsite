Increasing climate volatility, need to understand post-failure behavior and resilient “safe-to-fail”
rather than “fail-safe” infrastructure.Large deformations: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Coupled hydromechanical models for SPH. Model geomechanical problems:
retrogressive landslides, embankment failure
uilding upon dissertation work using SPH: Tailing dam stability and
failure. Dynamic and static liquefaction. Wave or debris flow-structure
interaction: simulating waves impacting coastal or offshore structures, e.g.
wind turbines. Large-scale 3D simulations leveraging HPC

Future: Regional-scale Simulation of Dam and Levee failure:
Modeling of Levee Failure due to overtopping, storm surge. 2D and 3D
modeling of dam break failure floods to develop emergency action plans
