Teaching Assistant, Stanford University, Graduate course (Master’s level), CEE 281: Mechanics and
Finite Elements. Winter 2025.

– Taught the class when professor was traveling, held biweekly office hours, graded the class prob-
lem sets, conducted additional classes to help students with their computing assignments, im-
plementation of 2D FEM code to solve Poisson’s equation over a unit square, as well as more
involved 2D BVPs including fluid seepage around a pile, and cantilever beam bending considering
different element types in the incompressible limit, and how to avoid volumetric locking.

– Student reviews: In the question “overall, how effective was the instruction you received from
this instructor?” out of 9 respondents (13 students total) I scored the “very effective” as the
median score. In the question “How much did you learn from this instructor?” I scored “A lot”
as the median score.
