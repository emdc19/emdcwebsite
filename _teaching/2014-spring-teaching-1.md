Teaching Assistant, Stanford University, Graduate course (PhD level), CEE 315: Plasticity Modeling
and Computation. Spring 2023.

– Held biweekly office hours, graded the class problem sets, conducted additional tutorials aug-
menting and further explaining class material, and helped students design their final projects,
implementing different constitutive models at the stress point level. Office hours consisted of
first working on additional example problems and then opening the floor to questions.

– Student reviews: In the question “overall, how effective was the instruction you received from this
instructor?” out of 7 respondents (12 students total) I scored the highest “extremely effective”
as the median score. Students also commented that I was “very helpful in the homework and
the project,” “Enrique was good at helping with the homework,” and that as an instructor my
teaching demonstrated the following characteristics, “knowledge on the subject,” “quick and
effective feedback,” and “patience.”
